# Objective: Apply basic Python arithmetic operations and variable assignments to 
# calculate the simple interest on a given principal amount, rate of interest, and time.
# I = P * R * T
principal = 1000
rate = 0.05
time = 3
interest = principal * rate * time
print ("The simple interest is:  " + str(interest))
